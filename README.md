### Project: Optimization of Object Detection Models for Varied Weather and Lighting Conditions

This project focuses on optimizing object detection models to enhance their accuracy and robustness under diverse environmental conditions, including varying weather and lighting scenarios, both indoors and outdoors. The pipeline leverages advanced tools such as PyTorch for model training, MLflow for experiment tracking, and DVC for data and model versioning. Additionally, matplotlib and seaborn are utilized for data visualization and analysis.

### Key Features of the Project:

#### Data Version Control (DVC):

- Tracks and versions datasets, models, and pipeline stages to ensure reproducibility across different environments.
- Enables structured pipeline stages (e.g., preprocessing, training, evaluation) that automatically re-execute if dependencies (such as data, scripts, or parameters) change.
- Supports remote data storage (e.g., DagsHub, S3) for managing large datasets and models efficiently.

#### Experiment Tracking with MLflow:

- Logs experiment metrics, parameters, and artifacts.
- Tracks hyperparameters and performance metrics for object detection models.
- Facilitates comparison of different runs and models, aiding in pipeline optimization.

- **preprocess.py** script handles dataset retrieval and preprocessing.
- Sources for datasets include:
  - [CCTV Curation Dataset](https://universe.roboflow.com/master-dataset-curation/cctv-curation-dataset-poc)
  - [COCO Dataset](https://gist.github.com/mkocabas/a6177fc00315403d31572e17700d7fd9)
  - [SFSU Synthetic Dataset](https://people.ee.ethz.ch/~csakarid/SFSU_synthetic/)
  - [DAWN Dataset](https://paperswithcode.com/datasets?q=DAWN&v=lst&o=match)
- Preprocessing includes comparing datasets, re-augmenting data to simulate varying lighting and weather conditions, and outputting clean, augmented data.

#### 2. Training:

- **train.py** script trains object detection models, leveraging the YOLO architecture from Ultralytics.
- Implements a train-test split strategy.
- experiment data augumentation strategies to enchance model robustness
- Utilizes grid search or random search for hyperparameter optimization .
- Logs models and hyperparameters to MLflow for tracking and analysis.

#### 3. Evaluation:

- **evaluate.py** script evaluates the trained modelâ€™s performance under various conditions.
- Logs metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and IoU to MLflow.
- Analyzes failed predictions to identify potential areas for improvement.
- also check the impack on differenct hardware configuration

#### 4. Optimization:

- Adjusts hyperparameters based on evaluation results.
- Implements final fine-tuning to improve model performance.
